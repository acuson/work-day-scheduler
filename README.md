# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

In this application, I apply logic to a work day scheduler using jQuery, Moment.js, and Bootstrap for styling.

## Basic Functionality
* When you view the application, the current date is displayed.
* Time blocks are created from 7am to 10pm. Each time block is shaded as gray if that time as passed, red if it's the current time, and green if it's a future time. 
* When you type something into the text area and click save, then the text is saved into local storage and remains after the page refreshes.
